## Repository Structure

```
git clone
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```
```
<p>
Explain that you need to re-run colcon build and source install/setup.bash whenever the code is modified, and re-run source install/setup.bash when you open a new terminal
Explain how to use ros2 run and ros2 launch to start package nodes in the workspace
Be as detailed as possible in the explanations. This should be a written guide that anyone can follow, regardless of linux/ROS/programming background
